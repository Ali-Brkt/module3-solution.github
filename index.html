          <h2>Chicken</h2>

        She heard the soft clucking behind her. That didn't bode well. What could be troubling her chickens this late at
        night, in this quiet part of the farm? And at this particular moment, just after she'd managed to save enough
        money to fix the old, creaking coop. Was there a cunning fox who'd had the same idea, and was now watching her
        flock, waiting for a chance to snatch the fruit of her labor? Or did the clucking mean that one of her chickens
        was sick and was just waiting to spread the illness to the others? She hurriedly looked all around. Suddenly she
        saw the shadow by the barn. Like lightning, she darted off to the left and disappeared between the two large
        haystacks, almost falling over the rake lying in the middle of the path. She tried to calmly assess the
        situation in the dim moonlight and suddenly stiffened: there was no sign of a predator; she would have to look
        elsewhere. The clucking got louder and louder; she saw the white plumage of a hen fluttering in the night. Is
        this the first sign of trouble? she thought, pressing herself back against the barn wall, trying to make her
        presence unknown, was all that planning and effort wasted? She was cold now, her palms damp with dew; she could
        feel her heart racing. Suddenly next to her, with a barely noticeable creak, a window swung quietly to and fro
        in the night's breeze. Could this be the vantage point she needed? Slowly she slid toward the window, pressing
        herself more and more into the wall, into the dark, away from her precious flock. Would this window reveal the
        source of her anxiety?
        Looking through, she saw themâ€”all her chickens, safe and sound, nestled together in their coop. It was then that
        she spotted it, a small, newly hatched chick, separated from the brood, chirping loudly for its mother. A wave
        of relief washed over her; the clucking was not a signal of danger, but the natural, soothing calls between a
        mother hen and her lost chick. Smiling, she walked toward the coop, ready to reunite the small family and
        finally put her worries to rest. Tonight, under her vigilant care, the chickens would sleep peacefully, and she
        could go back to her warm bed, heart full and content with the small, lively farm she nurtured every day.
